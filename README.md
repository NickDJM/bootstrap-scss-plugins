# bootstrap-scss-plugins

A suite of SCSS plugins used for developing Bootstrap 4 themes and sites.

This package aims to add a few useful tools to help speed up development of themes in Bootstrap 4 by adding some quick classes and mixins.

**Can't you do this yourself by editing some variables?**

Of course you can! This package exists purely to make it faster to replicate some commonly used customizations.

## Usage

There are a couple ways in use these plugins:

1. Add all of them to your project by importing the `plugin.scss` file found in the root `scss/` directory, or
2. Add individual plugins by importing the other `.scss` files found in the root `scss/` directory.

Once you have done that, you can use them as you would any other bootstrap feature.
